With its bare aesthetics, this vivid purple SWISSGEAR bag is a true jewel. Reminiscent of a tote, it features a polyester body of a large main compartment and an outer packet for cards and pens that hangs on a broad adjustable shoulder strap. Piquing the attention with its slender square structure, the bag shows a cheeky character with a stout thong that juts from one corner and merges into the strap. Want a sporty bag to carry your essentials and show some flair – the Jewel CrossBody bag is the one.
